This To-Do Web App is for demonstration purposes only. It is written
using primarily HTML5, CSS3, OO JavaScript, jQuery and jQuery UI. All
ToDo items are stored locally using the localStorage API so there is 
no back-end code what-so-ever and runs completely in the browser. The
localStorage API provides browser-specific, persistant storage across
sessions so the list items will persist until the browser's cache is 
emptied. The items are not avaliable in any other browser or on any 
other computer, nor is this app secure or hack-proof.

Use at your own risk.
